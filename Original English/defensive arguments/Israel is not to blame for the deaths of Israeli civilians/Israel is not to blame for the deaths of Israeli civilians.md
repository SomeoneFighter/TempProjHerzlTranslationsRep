The war in Israel is not only spilling the blood of militants and soldiers, but also of civilians who were murdered, killed and bombed during the ongoing war. Israeli civilians are always in the frame when Israel is taking action. Except for the Israeli hostages who are at risk by getting bombed or shot by its own forces, the entire population of Israel is targeted by enemy countries and militant groups basically anywhere.

‎

Recently some people started actively blame Israel on killing its own civilians, whether it is by shooting at hostages or misfiring rockets. In such scenarios they always expect Israel to take the entire responsibility.

‎

Like in every war when civilians are involved they sometimes are getting killed by the actions of their side during the battle. Israel's intention is to save and rescue Israelis, and sometimes the intention to save your people leads to the opposite. But there is a big difference between the intention and the result.

‎

Israel's actions are mostly justified by the international law:
*Under **Article 51 of the UN Charter**, states have the right to defend themselves against an armed attack.*
*Under **Article 3 of the Geneva Convention IV**, parties to a conflict are entitled to take measures to protect their civilians and civilian objects from the effects of hostilities.*

‎

**Notice:**
*Non-state actors, including groups like Hamas or Hezbollah, can be condemned for actions that violate international law. While international law primarily addresses states, it also applies to armed groups, particularly in the context of armed conflict and humanitarian law.*

‎


‎

**Explanation of some events where Israeli civilians were potentially killed by Israel's actions:**

‎

## Majdal Shams attack (27 July 2024 / 12 killed):
(remark: non Israelis were killed, but it happened in a territory that Israel controls)
Hezbollah launched a rocket that crossed the Israeli border. Hezbollah isn't fighting a defensive war, they attacked Israel even before Israel invaded Gaza, so it already goes against the UN Charter: **Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (1945)**  which states that ***"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."***

‎

There are two options regarding what Hezbollah was targeting: Majdal Shams or a military base. Hezbollah claims they targeted the Israeli base and that the attack on Majdal Shams was caused by a misfire of an Iron Dome missile. [Many pieces of evidence point to Hezbollah's rocket being responsible for the incident in Majdal Shams.](https://apnews.com/article/israel-golan-heights-soccer-rocket-hezbollah-explained-97d4377713a209cf130b7b0f3476e1c4)

‎

However, in both scenarios, according to the law, Israel can't be accountable for killing civilians.
The situation is clear in the first case: if Hezbollah targeted a civilian area (which they do on a daily basis), they would be violating several international laws and principles.
Under **Article 3 of the Geneva Convention IV** as previously mentioned, Israel has the right to defend itself. Even if Hezbollah targeted the military base, Israel did not violate any international law by attempting to intercept the attack.

‎

## The hostage case in Beeri (7 October 2023 / 13 killed):
About 40 terrorists barricaded themselves in the house with 15 hostages. A tank that was previously at the massacre site at the Nova festival arrived at the scene, and fired two shells at the house, the first at the grass in the yard of the house where there were 6 hostages, and the second at the roof of the house. The roof of the house collapsed. After that, Israeli forces broke into the house and ended the battle. Of the 15 hostages that the terrorists held there, two survived.

‎

So Hamas violated the **Article 3** and **Fourth Geneva Convention: This convention deals with the protection of civilians in times of war and prohibits the taking of hostages in occupied territories.**

‎

[According to the IDF investigation](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/bksm8havr)
and by many estimates the hostages were murdered by Hamas or by a crossfire, but there was a case where an Israeli tank potentially killed one of the hostages.

‎

Regardless, Israel had the right to use force according to **Article 51 of the United Nations Charter**. The investigation shows that the Israeli special forces were negotiating with the Hamas militants before using force. In this case, the Israeli forces acted in accordance with **Human Rights Law** which states: ***"In situations involving hostages, general human rights law obligates states to act to save lives, and states may invoke the necessity to prevent further harm to hostages. This can create a complex interplay between the obligation to preserve hostages' rights and the state's right to protect its citizens."***

‎

[The fight came to an end when one of the last terrorists decided to surrender, he used one of the hostages as a human shield and went out. At that point the Israeli forces stopped the fire.](https://youtu.be/gi-ESUGUUMk)

‎

## Apache Helicopters at the Nova Festival (October 7, 2023 / 350+ killed):
(No information about how many of these were killed by Israel)

‎

A lot of [missinformation](https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1723022290886025424) has been spread about this event. It cannot be accurately investigated based on open sources, but I will include most of the available versions:

‎

On October 7, dozens of Hamas militants invaded the Nova festival. During that day, more than 350 Israeli civilians were killed, and many were taken captive. At least two Apache helicopters were operating in the area and engaged targets on the ground. [According to the Israeli pilots](https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1nch1cuc), the forces on the ground did not provide them with sufficient information to correctly assess the situation, and the pilots had to operate based on their protocols and understanding. Due to this lack of information, they periodically opened fire on targets they believed were likely Hamas militants.

‎

Hamas violated **Article 3** of the **Geneva Conventions and the Fourth Geneva Convention, which deal with the protection of civilians in times of war and prohibit the taking of hostages in occupied territories**. Hamas deliberately targeted civilians, which is a violation of **International Humanitarian Law**.

‎

Given this situation, Israel needed to use force to protect civilians and eliminate the terrorists, according to the **right to self-defense**.

‎

There was no intention on the part of Israeli forces to target their own civilians. Even if there were cases of unintentional killings, this does not constitute a violation of international law. Israel had to act, and Hamas is the only party to blame for creating this situation, even if Israel potentially caused harm to its own civilians. What Hamas did constitutes a **principle of aggression**, and Israel has the right to respond.
