## Land Ownership in Palestine Pre-1948: A Closer Look  

Pro-Palestinian arguments frequently cite the **1945 British Village Statistics** or similar maps to claim that Arabs owned approximately 50% of the land in Mandatory Palestine, compared to Jewish ownership of just 7%. These figures are then used to argue that the 1947 UN Partition Plan, which allocated 55% of the land to the Jewish state and 45% to the Arab state, was inherently unfair. However, the reality behind these numbers is far more complex and nuanced.  
‎
#### The Historical Context of Land Ownership and Partition  
Even if Arab leaders had been offered significantly more land—such as the 70% allocation proposed by the 1937 **Peel Commission**, which left the Jews with only 20%—it is unlikely they would have agreed. Arab leadership at the time consistently rejected partition proposals, refusing to acknowledge any Jewish sovereignty in Palestine. Their position was unequivocal: they sought a single Arab-majority state, with Jews relegated to a minority role.  
‎
#### Misleading Sources: Sami Hadawi's Statistics  
Pro-Palestinian activists often cite Sami Hadawi's report, *Government of Palestine, Village Statistics 1945*, to support their claims. However, it is crucial to distinguish between Hadawi’s later interpretations and the original British 1945 survey. Hadawi’s works, which claim Arabs owned 90% of Palestine, are widely criticized as propagandist and lack grounding in the original British data.  
‎
#### The Reality of Arab Land Ownership in the 1945 British Statistics  
When examining the original British survey and carefully calculating the numbers, it is true that Arab ownership appears to account for roughly 47% of the land. However, the method of calculation reveals critical limitations.  
‎
‎ ‎1. **Taxation-Based Data**  
   The 1945 British statistics were compiled by the Department of Taxation, not the Land Registry Office. The Land Registry Office, constrained by limited resources, had formally registered only about 6,000 dunams (out of the roughly 26,000 dunams in Mandatory Palestine). The reliance on taxation records introduced inaccuracies, as tax data included land types that didn’t equate to private ownership.  
‎
‎ ‎2. **Ottoman Land Code of 1858**  
   The categorization of land ownership in Palestine was based on the Ottoman Land Code, which divided land into five primary categories:  
‎ ‎ **-** **Waqf**: Land endowed for religious purposes.  
‎ ‎ **-** **Mulk (Milk)**: Privately owned land, held in absolute ownership.  
‎ ‎ **-** **Miri**: State land leased to individuals for cultivation; ultimate ownership rested with the state.  
‎ ‎ **-** **Matruka**: Land designated for communal use, such as pastures or roads.  
‎ ‎ **-** **Mewat (Mawat)**: "Dead" land, uncultivated and unclaimed, often far from settlements.  
‎
Under these definitions, much of the land categorized as "Arab-owned" in the British survey fell under **Miri land**, where tenants paid taxes but did not hold private ownership. Many Arab fellahin (peasants) worked land owned by absentee landlords—often Arab elites residing in Syria, Lebanon, or Jordan—yet this tenant-occupied land was still counted as "Arab-owned" in taxation records.  
‎
#### Actual Arab Private Land Ownership  
When private land ownership (Mulk or Milk) is isolated, Arab ownership is considerably lower than the 47% figure often cited. Estimates vary, but one analysis suggests that state-owned land accounted for about 70% of Palestine. Subtracting state-owned land from the total leaves Arab private ownership at roughly **17–25%**, depending on the methodology used.  
‎
#### Implications for the Partition Plan  
The 1947 UN Partition Plan allocated significantly more land to the proposed Arab state than Arabs privately owned. Even with their claim to Miri land included, the partition offered Arabs a larger share than what they privately controlled. The Jewish state, despite being allocated 55% of the land, would have absorbed the vast Negev Desert, which was sparsely populated and largely barren.

This data demonstrates that claims of Arab dispossession in 1947 fail to consider the nuanced realities of land ownership and use. The partition plan not only reflected geopolitical realities but also sought to allocate land proportionate to existing populations and their needs, offering Arabs more than they privately owned.
