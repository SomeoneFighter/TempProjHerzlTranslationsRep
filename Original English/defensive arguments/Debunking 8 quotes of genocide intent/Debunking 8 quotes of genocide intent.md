this is the debunking of the first 8 quotes (out of 22) of this pdf file https://law4palestine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Database-of-Israeli-Incitement-to-Genocide-including-after-ICJ-order-27th-February-2024-.pdf provided as an intent for genocide. why 22? because they are of the decision makers, the other don't matter

‎

## 1.  **11/11/2023 Yoav Gallant, Minister of Defense, "civilian harm":**
> I am saying here to the citizens of Lebanon, I already see the citizens in Gaza walking with white flags along the coast... If Hezbollah makes mistakes of this kind, the ones who will pay the price are first of all the citizens of Lebanon. What we are doing in Gaza, we know how to do in Beirut.

https://www.maariv.co.il/news/military/Article-1051388 - video
full quote (rough translation):  "**Hezbollah is dragging Lebanon into a war that could happen**.  If Hezbollah makes mistakes of this kind **here**, the ones who will pay the price are first of all the citizens of Lebanon. What we are doing in Gaza, we know how to do in Beirut. And therefore, I hope for that front Hezbollah will act accordingly and Nasrallah** will stop his provocations** because that kind of **aggression** is unacceptable".

‎

so clearly just defensive posturing and "we will respond harshly against aggression". Not a call for genocide of any kind

‎

## 2. **09/10/2023 Yoav Gallant, Minister of Defense, "civilian harm / collective punishment":**
> We will end things inside Gaza […]. I have removed all restraints, [you’re allowed to] attack everything, kill those who fight us, whether there is one terrorist or there are hundreds of terrorists, [ordering to attack] through the air, land, with tanks, with bulldozers, by all means, there are no compromises. Gaza will not return to what it was.

https://www.ynet.co.il/blogs/israelatwar4de/article/sj7qyeqzt - video
full quote (rough translation): "**We will defeat Hamas and reach everywhere we need. There's no way our children will be killed in those bushes and the people of Israel will continue as usual.** I have removed all restraints, removing gloves, kill anyone who fights us, whether there is one terrorist or there are hundreds of terrorists, through the air, land, with tanks, with bulldozers, by all means, there are no compromises. Gaza will not return to what it was - **Hamas will not stay here**.

‎

so clearly the meaning that Hamas will be eliminated and that's why Gaza will not return to what it was. The quote in the pdf removes the final "Hamas will not stay here" part very maliciously.

## 3. **12/11/2023 Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, "genocidal intent / civilian harm / collective punishment":**
**this isn't a quote this is just:**
Benjamin Netanyahu Calls Civilian Deaths in Gaza "Collateral Damage" The Israeli prime minister’s comments come as the Palestinian death toll soars over 11,000
https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-netanyahu-everyone-in-the-world-is-sitting-on-the-bleachers-197679685846 - video
if we want to accuse Bibi of genocidal intent I think it goes against our narrative to include a video of him clearly saying "*We set a specific target that is to destroy Hamas' military capabilities and to destroy its governance capabilities over its million of people its hosting in Gaza*", or , "*we are gonna achieve it, well do it with as few civilian casualties as we can and with maximum casualties on Hamas terrorists*", "*were proceeding as quickly as we can but also as carefully as we can because we wanna minimize civilian casualties*", “***We’re deliberately doing everything in our power to target the terrorists,” “And the civilians, as happens in every legitimate war, are sometimes what are called ‘collateral damage.’ That’s a longer way of saying unintended casualties***." 

‎

Its actually impressive how much effort he is doing to **not show** genocidal intent in this entire video which is why I find it weird why it was included here at all. Calling civilians "collateral damage" does not inherently make civilian harm lawful. For harm to be considered lawful, it must meet the criteria of **necessity**, **distinction**, and **proportionality **, three principles in International Law which Israel follows.

‎

## 4. **07/10/2023 Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, "civilian harm / collective punishment":**
> Gaza is the city of evil, we will turn all the places** in which Hamas deploys** and hides into ruins.** I am telling the people of Gaza – get out of there now**. We will act everywhere and with full power.

https://www.kikar.co.il/political-news/s26az1 - video
I don't know why this quote was included as well, there's clear distinction between Hamas and Gazans and even an urge of Bibi for Gazan's safety. This is not genocidal intent.

‎

## 5. **17/11/2023 Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, :genocidal intent / civilian harm / collective punishment":**
> It is necessary to make cultural changes in Gaza such as in Japan and Germany following WWII.

Also not really sure how its an indication of genocidal intent. Were the Germans or the Japanese genocided during the war? Bibi is talking about the denazification of Gaza that definitely should take place after the war just like it did for Germany and Japan and look how great those two countries turned out https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/name-of-shop-is-hitler-and-i-like-him-because-he-was-the-most-anti-jewish-person-432190

## 6. **14/12/2023 Yoav Gallant, Minister of Defense, "civilian harm / forced displacement":**
After making the northern part of the Gaza strip inhabitable - "the campaign will last for months to come and include the southern area of the strip" 
https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/s1js0nw4a - video
there's actually a typo, it should've said "**uninhabitable**" very unprofessional from their side. Its also important to show how in the same link that they posted Gallant says: "*We are indeed focused on the Gaza Strip and the southern front and operate with large forces, but it is equally important for us to maintain the security of the residents of the north. We are prepared and will know what to do against any threat*." Also the north is not uninhabitable, that video was posted in November of 2023 when even in July its still very much inhabitable: https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/interview/2024/07/09/life-in-northern-gaza-palestine "Shalabi: I don’t have the exact number of people living in my town, but it’s almost empty. Maybe half of the population is there, I'm not sure. Statistics are talking about 400,000 to 600,000 people in the area of the north of Gaza and Gaza City still living here." 
Also to imply that the same will happen to the south when they made people move to the south for safety is ridiculous.

## 7. **18/11/2023 Yoav Gallant, Minister of Defense, "genocidal intent":**
"Soon they'll realize the IDF's power, even in the southern part [of Gaza]" he added: "Those who were on the western side of Gaza City understand this well and have already met the deadly power of the IDF, those who are on the eastern side understand this tonight and will understand it in the coming days, and those who are in the south of the Gaza Strip will also understand this soon."
https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/hksy6ui4p - video
It doesn't really show that full quote in the video but the article itself does explain it well itself: Minister Galant said that there is no action that the IDF hesitates to take, and that with each passing day the places where Hamas terrorists can roam are decreasing: "Those who have been on the western side of Gaza City understand this well and have already met the lethal force of the IDF, those who are on the eastern side will understand this tonight and will understand it in the coming days, and those who are in the south of the Gaza Strip will also understand it soon."

‎

So as anyone could see its referencing Hamas' free roam in Gaza and that they should fear it and not Gazans' free roam. Very embarrassing to include an article that debunks the quote itself as non-genocidal.

‎

## 8. **19/11/2023 Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, civilian harm / collective punishment:**
"[aid] is important for our allies to stand beside us, without it they'll find it hard to support us [regarding their actions in the strip]" (writer note: this is regarding fuel entering the Gaza strip for the first time since oct 7 - agreed upon is "two tanks a day") "It is impossible to establish a military victory without political backing, and that the cabinet insists on Israel's security
interests in the face of strong opposition". At this point, Netanyahu explained that humanitarian aid to Gaza is necessary for continued international support for Israel, and that without such aid - even its good friends will have difficulty supporting it for a long time, and it will be very difficult for Israel to continue the war until the end: "That's why when the IDF and Shin Bet jointly recommended to the cabinet to accept The war cabinet unanimously agreed to the American request to allow a limited entry of two fuel tankers a day into the southern Gaza Strip." Netanyahu added: The amount of fuel that will be put into the Strip is a minimum emergency amount whose purpose is to operate water and sewage pumps, without which the immediate spread of epidemics is expected, which could also harm IDF soldiers and Israeli citizens.

I don't really get the point. Do they expect Israel to let fuel out of goodwill even though that fuel would be used against them? No state ever does things out of goodwill but rather out of interest. And as for Gaza's fortune, Israel lets the entry as of today 28.8.24 of 380,000 litres per day as opposed to the time of the articles postage of 70,000 litres per day. Is their point that Israel would stop fuel would it not for international eyes? Well, Israel would do a lot of things differently were it not for international eyes but that is Israel in a different reality.
