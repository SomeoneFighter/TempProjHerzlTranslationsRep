The blockade didn't just come out of nowhere. It was imposed in response to years of relentless attacks on Israel by Hamas and it hasn't been without cause. Israel has repeatedly offered concessions on the degree to which it will ease the blockade if Hamas would simply come to the peace table but those offers have been persistently rejected by Hamas. It didn't cause the problems in Gaza It was a response to them. If Hamas would end its attacks and simply acknowledge the reality of Israel, the blockade would be eased and the Gaza economy would rebound but they made the sick decision to choose terrorism over the welfare of its own people. The plight of the Palestinians is a tragedy. a tragedy that has been prolonged by Palestinian leaders who refuse to acknowledge the basic reality that Israel is not going anywhere

2014 Gaza War: During the 2014 Gaza War (Operation Protective Edge), Israel proposed easing the blockade in return for a long-term truce and the disarmament of Hamas. The proposals included easing restrictions on goods and materials entering Gaza. Hamas, however, rejected the terms, and the conflict continued.

2018-2019 Proposals: In response to escalating tensions and protests along the Gaza border in 2018-2019, Israel made several offers to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. These offers included increasing the flow of goods and allowing more construction materials into Gaza, contingent on a halt to violence and ongoing negotiations. Hamas did not agree to these conditions, and the cycle of violence persisted.
