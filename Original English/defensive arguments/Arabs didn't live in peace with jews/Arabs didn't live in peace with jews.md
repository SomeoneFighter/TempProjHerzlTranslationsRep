Many pro-Palestinians argue that before the establishment of Israel, Jews in Arab states lived in harmony, enjoying peace and equality. While it’s true that Jewish life in the Arab world was often better than in Europe, the idea of a peaceful coexistence with equality is a myth that falls apart under scrutiny.
‎
### Context Matters
Jewish life in the Arab world varied greatly depending on the time and place. A Jew living under one caliph might have enjoyed relative prosperity, only to face persecution under the next. Similarly, Jews in one region, like Syria, might have had better rights than those in Yemen. The volatility and unpredictability of Jewish life as dhimmis—non-Muslims under Islamic rule—underscored their precarious status. 
‎
### Humiliation and "Nudging" to Convert
The status of dhimmis was inherently humiliating, often designed to pressure Jews and Christians to convert to Islam. For example, while the **jizya** (a tax on non-Muslims) was similar to the **zakat** (a tax for Muslims), the **kharaj** (a land tax on dhimmis) was much harsher. After Muhammad’s conquest of Khaybar, Jewish residents were forced to give **half** of their agricultural yield to the Muslim conquerors just to remain on their land¹.  
‎
This "soft" coercion was highly effective over time. The Arab world didn’t become predominantly Muslim because its original inhabitants suddenly decided to adopt Arab and Islamic culture out of admiration—it was through these subtle pressures.
‎
### Other Forms of Discrimination
Beyond taxes, dhimmis were subject to various degrading restrictions. These included the **Corvée Labor**, which often relegated Jews to humiliating tasks like tending corpses². Some dhimmis were forced to wear distinguishing clothing or symbols, while others had to dismount from their animals when in the presence of Muslims. Certain jobs and professions, especially public roles, were completely off-limits to Jews³.
‎
While such rules weren’t always strictly enforced and varied depending on the ruler, they served as constant reminders to Jews of their subordinate status. Even in their "best" periods, Jews in Arab lands lived under the shadow of second-class citizenship.
‎
### The Modern Perspective
It’s crucial to recognize that Jewish life in the Arab world, while sometimes less violent than in Europe, was still deeply unequal. These discriminatory practices persisted well into the 20th century and played a significant role in the eventual **Jewish exodus from Arab lands** following Israel’s creation. Today, Jews around the world have the option of making **aliyah** to Israel, where they can live without fear of such systemic discrimination.
