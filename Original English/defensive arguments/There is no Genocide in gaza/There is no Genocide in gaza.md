# Debunking Genocide claims
To substantiate a claim of genocide, one must demonstrate both intent and action aimed at the systematic extermination of a particular group. If Israel's intent was genuinely to annihilate the Palestinian population, would they [drop leaflets instructing civilians to evacuate areas about to become conflict zones](https://footage.projectherzl.com/detail.html?category=Roof%20Knocking)? Would they establish humanitarian zones and allow trucks carrying essential aid into the Gaza Strip? These actions illustrate that the IDF prioritizes the safety of civilians, contradicting the assertion of genocidal intent.

‎

Analyzing the current conflict's casualties reveals further nuances. According to Hamas, approximately 6,000 militants died as of February (2024), suggesting a monthly death rate of around 750, which could total around 12,000 by May. Assuming a conservative estimate that 2,000 of these casualties were not militants, we might consider a total of 10,000 militants. Reports indicate that out of 40,000 total casualties, around 70% are women and children, equating to about 28,000. This leaves 10,000 men, 10,000 of whom are presumed militants, resulting in approximately 2,000 innocent men. This yields a civilian-to-militant casualty ratio of about 3:1, which is below the global average of 9:1 for urban warfare. and lets not forget that Hamas [**using Human Shields**](https://arguments.projectherzl.com/offensive-arguments.html?argument=Hamas-usage-of-human-shields), and that gaza density is very high. but even with those difficulties, the ratio is still 3:1, which again, falling under the global average of urban warfare. that just further showing that Israel precise with their own attacks and does not target Civilians.

‎

This ratio demonstrates that Israel’s actions do not reflect a systematic intent to exterminate a population; rather, they indicate targeted operations against militants. The absence of a higher casualty rate among non-combatants shows a lack of both intent and action that is necessary to define genocide. Even if we account for potential overestimations and add an extra 10,000 to the civilian casualty count, the ratio would shift to 4:1—still lower than the average ratio. Notably, neutral sources suggest that the civilian-to-combatant ratio might be as favorable as 2:1, further indicating that Israel's actions are not aimed at genocide but rather at targeting militant groups.

‎

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry’s statistics, the casualty demographics indicate that 39.4% of those killed are males aged 18-59, with 18.9% being women and 32.2% children under 18. This data suggests that the majority of casualties are indeed adult males, likely including combatants, further supporting the argument that Israel is not indiscriminately targeting civilians but rather focusing on militant operatives.

‎

the claim that Israel shouldn't had attacked Gaza at all, since there will be casualties, is purely ignorant.
every casualty is a tragedy, indeed, but Casualties are an inevitable part of any war. You cannot simply abandon a war due to the potential for future casualties on the other side. That’s not how wars operate, nor is it a sound moral principle. If it were, any country could initiate an attack and then claim immunity from retaliation, making aggression the ultimate war tactic. But the reality is far more complex, and such a notion fundamentally misunderstands the nature of war and morality.

‎

Claims of genocide prior to the current conflict overlook crucial historical context. During the Ottoman Empire's rule, there were approximately 500,000 Arabs living in the region that is now Israel. The influx of Jewish immigrants, who developed the land and created job opportunities, led to a significant migration of Arabs into the area. Today, the population of Arabs in the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) and Gaza has surged to around 5 million. This demographic growth—multiplying tenfold—contradicts the notion of genocide, as the population has significantly increased rather than diminished.

‎

Finally, regarding the claim that "the blockade was created to starve Gaza's economy," this assertion has been debunked. For a detailed examination of this claim, read [**this**](https://arguments.projectherzl.com/defensive-arguments.html?argument=The-blockade-was-created-to-starve-out-Gaza%27s-economy-(debunking)) argument.

‎

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that Israel’s actions in Gaza do not meet the legal or moral definitions of genocide. Instead, they reflect a complex reality characterized by conflict with a recognized militant organization, Hamas, which has historically used civilians as shields in warfare ([**⁠Hamas usage of human shields**](https://arguments.projectherzl.com/offensive-arguments.html?argument=Hamas-usage-of-human-shields)). This context underscores that the Israeli Defense Forces are acting in defense of their nation while attempting to minimize civilian harm, contrary to the narrative of genocidal intent.
