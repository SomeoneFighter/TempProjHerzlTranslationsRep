Some people claim that Arabs, as a group, not specifically Palestinians, originated from the land of Israel, asserting that the true ancestors of modern-day Arabs are the Nabateans, Qedarites, and Adnanites, rather than the Qahtanites (Himyarites). This claim is factually incorrect.

‎  

Arabs trace their origins back to Yemen, which is home to the most prominent and ancient Arab clans. Yemen has long been regarded as the birthplace of Arab identity, not the Levant, Maghreb, or Mesopotamia.

‎  

The Nabateans, an ancient tribe from the southern Levant and Negev desert, the Qedarites, a northern Arabian tribe, and the Adnanites, a northern Arab tribe, were not considered "pure Arabs" by early genealogists. Instead, they were "Arabized" peoples, groups who adopted the Arabic language and culture through interactions with southern Arabian tribes but were not part of the original Arab lineage.

‎  

The Nabateans, originally from the Levant, had a distinct culture before Arabization, influenced by the Greeks and Romans, with their own language, Nabataean Aramaic, and unique religious practices. The Qedarites, like the Nabateans, had their own traditions and language, closer to Aramaic and Akkadian, reflecting their interaction with Mesopotamian civilizations. They were also traders and had a significant presence in the northeastern Arabian Peninsula, before becoming part of the broader Arab identity. These tribes, along with the Adnanites, were integrated into the larger Arab world through the spread of Islam and the influence of the southern Qahtanite Arabs.

‎

The Qedarites and Nabateans never referred to themselves as Arabs. While the Assyrians did use the term "Arab" to describe them, it’s important to note that the term was applied by outsiders as a general label for nomadic tribes across the Arabian Peninsula, which included non-Arabs as well. Therefore, it's not surprising that the Assyrians referred to the Qedarites as Arabs, as this term was not used in the same way we understand "Arabs" today.

‎

The oldest and most authentic Arabs are the Qahtanites, specifically the Himyarites, who are widely recognized as the closest ancestors of modern Arabs. These tribes, rooted in southern Arabia, particularly Yemen, represent the true origins of Arab identity.

‎  

Therefore, Arabs did not originate from "Palestine" but from the southern Arabian Peninsula, with Yemen serving as the cradle of their history and culture. Language and culture don't always emerge in the place where a group becomes dominant. While the Nabateans, Qedarites, and Adnanites contributed to the spread of Arabic language and culture, they were not the original Arabs. The true Arabs trace their origins to Yemen and the Qahtanite tribes, with the Himyarites being the most prominent and ancient of them all.
