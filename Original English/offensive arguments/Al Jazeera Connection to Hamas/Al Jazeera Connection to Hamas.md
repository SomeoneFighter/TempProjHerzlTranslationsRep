Al Jazeera, a prominent news network, has faced allegations of close ties with Hamas, the Palestinian militant organization. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have released documents suggesting that six Al Jazeera journalists are affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, serving in various capacities within these groups. Additionally, a Tel Aviv District Court found evidence of a "close, long-term connection" between Al Jazeera and Hamas, noting that the network's content has served Hamas's interests. 

‎  

The daily lies of the Aljazeera network inflating the number of dead in the Gaza Strip.
This has long since become a regular phenomenon but no one is taking what is necessary to stop it.
Every day, Aljazeera reports on fabricated and inflated death tolls coming from its journalists in the Gaza Strip, most of them Hamas operatives who use Aljazeera's platform to rally support in the Western world against the "genocide in Gaza".

‎  

For example, Al Jazeera [reported](https://i.postimg.cc/QNmpkp9K/IMG-20250104-182230-970.png) (30 November 2024) about 100 dead in the Gaza Strip since Saturday morning.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, which is also under the control of Hamas to one degree or another but tries to maintain a certain decency so that the West will recognize the number of dead it reports, [announced](https://i.postimg.cc/MH3fkmVs/IMG-20250104-182214-863.png) a completely different number:
47 deaths were counted on Saturday.
That is less than half of what Al Jazeera reported.

‎  

Al Jazeera [claims](https://i.postimg.cc/mrWzGD1G/IMG-20250104-181945-136.png) that the number of dead in the Gaza Strip since the morning hours of Wednesday until nine in the evening (5 december 2024) has reached 76.
[According](https://i.postimg.cc/zBJyVckt/IMG-20250104-181937-885.png) to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, the total number of dead in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, yesterday (midnight to midnight) reached 48.
That means Al Jazeera added their own 58% bonus to the number of dead.

‎  

Al Jazeera [again lies](https://i.postimg.cc/NFFLx2SR/IMG-20250104-180724-279.png) and inflates the number of dead in the Gaza Strip.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza:
77 dead in Gaza in the past day (Thursday)
Al Jazeera yesterday as of 22:51:
90 killed in attacks in Gaza since Thursday morning.
Al Jazeera added 30 percent above the report by the Gaza Ministry of Health.

‎  

Aljazeera from "medical sources":
70 killed in attacks in the Gaza Strip on Friday.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza:
59 dead in the Gaza Strip on Friday.
11 dead - Aljazeera's "bonus", [this time](https://i.postimg.cc/xjpX1gN5/IMG-20250104-180517-431.png) "only" 18% exaggeration.

‎  

Palestinian media [reports](https://i.postimg.cc/RV3N6fcB/IMG-20250104-181419-256.png) that the Fatah movement, headed by Abu Mazen, has decided to prevent the Al Jazeera network from operating in the West Bank, due to the nature of the coverage of the Palestinian Authority's activities against the armed terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp in recent weeks.
Even Fatah admits that there is a connecting thread between Aljazeera and terrorism...

in the 7 images attached to this argument, there are documents revealing the involvement of Al Jazeera journalists as terrorist operatives.
