Throughout history, Palestinian leaders have been presented with numerous opportunities to achieve peace alongside the Jewish people. On at least six occasions, they were offered two-state solutions that could have provided them with autonomy and prosperity. Rather than seizing these opportunities to build a thriving nation, one that could have become the 'Singapore of the Middle East', they repeatedly chose the path of conflict. Instead of fostering coexistence and progress, these leaders have often resorted to rejection, driven by a refusal to accept a Jewish state as their neighbor.
This choice has led to generations of suffering for the Palestinian people, as resources and energy were funneled into war and resistance rather than building infrastructure, improving education, or advancing the economy. Each missed opportunity has only deepened the divisions and prolonged the suffering on both sides.

# Main
[in this poll](https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/823) on 2020, only minority of the Palestinians, 43%, supported 2 states solution.
that's without them having a state already, they just wont agree for a Jewish state beside their.

‎

The original Hamas Charter, established in 1988, stated that the Jews were responsible for a range of global conspiracies and were depicted as enemies of Islam. The Charter included calls for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in its place. It framed the conflict with Israel in terms of a religious struggle, suggesting that the eradication of the Jewish state was a necessary step for achieving Islamic goals.
It remains true after Hamas released a new charter in 2017, which essentially simply swapped the word “Jew” out and replaced it with “Zionist” while repeating antisemitic tropes.

‎

one of the quotes in the charter:
> The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.

‎

in 20/8/24 the "resistance in Gaza" (Hamas and the factions) published a letter that it sent to the "Islamic resistance in Lebanon" (Hezbollah). Here is a line from it:
"حان أيها الأبطال المجاهدون التقدم نحو فتح باب خيبر من جديد والعمل لزوال "إسرائيل" من الوجود"
"It is time, to advance towards opening the gate of Khaybar (A Saudi city that was conquered by the Prophet Muhammad and where Jewish tribes lived) again and work to eliminate “Israel” from existence".

# Hamas in its own words
* Ismail Haniyeh in 2020: He [**explained**](https://www.memri.org/tv/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-we-entitled-airport-seaport-projects-will-not-give-up-weapons-resistance-in-exchange) that Hamas rejects ceasefire agreements by which, "Gaza would become Singapore", preferring to remain at war with Israel until a Palestinian state is established from the River to the Sea: "We cannot, in exchange for money or projects, give up Palestine and our weapons. We will not give up the resistance... **We will not recognize Israel, Palestine must stretch from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea"**.

‎

* Hamas official, Hamad Al-Regeb in an April 2023 [**sermon**](https://www.memri.org/tv/rafah-gaza-friday-sermon-hamas-official-regeb-allah-necks-jews-annihilate-them): He prayed for "annihilation" and "paralysis" of the Jews whom he described as filthy animals: "[Allah] transformed them into filthy, ugly animals like apes and pigs because of the injustice and evil they had brought about". Al-Regeb also prayed for the ability to "get to the necks of the Jews".

‎

* Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Saleh Al-Arouri in an August 2023 interview:  He expressed Hamas’ desire for "total war" with Israel: "Therefore, we are convinced that if a total conflict begins, the airspace and seaports of this entity will be shut down, and they will not be able to live without electricity, water, and communications".

‎

* Ahmad Abd Al-Hadi (Hamas representative in Lebanon) in an October 12, 2023 TV show laid out Hamas’ expectation that it would be Israel that would sue for peace and indicated that a [**ceasefire is part of Hamas’ overall strategy**](https://www.memri.org/tv/hamas-rep-lebanon-ahmad-abd-hadi-strategic-deception-israel-think-not-want-war-attacks-west-bank), but said that he was not at liberty to say what exactly Hamas has planned for the next step after a ceasefire. He also stated that October 7 had achieved its intended purpose of landing "a blow to the normalization (of relations between Israel and Arab countries)".

‎

* Hamas member, [**Ghazi Hamad**](https://www.memri.org/reports/hamas-official-ghazi-hamad-we-will-repeat-october-7-attack-time-and-again-until-israel) on October 24, 2023: "Israel is a country that has no place on our land […] because it constitutes a security, military, and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nation". (October 24, 2023, LBC TV (Lebanon)). He also vowed to **repeat the October 7 attacks "[time and again until Israel is annihilated](https://www.memri.org/reports/hamas-official-ghazi-hamad-we-will-repeat-october-7-attack-time-and-again-until-israel)"**, and expressing a desire to "sacrifice martyrs" (referring to Gazan civilians) for Hamas’ ideological aim of destroying Israel.

‎

* In a [**speech**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlmUxKx37c8) before the International Union of Muslim Scholars in Doha on January 9, 2024, Ismaeel Haniyeh, chairman of Hamas's political bureau, called the October 7 massacre the "advanced [battle] front of the Ummah". Calling for "financial jihad" (donations to Hamas) and "jihad of the teeth" (physical jihad), he asked the international audience, "Who wishes to invest in building the jihadist generation to liberate Jerusalem and to unite the blood of the Ummah with the blood of the people of Gaza, Jerusalem, and Palestine on the land of Palestine for its liberation and the liberation of Jerusalem?"
