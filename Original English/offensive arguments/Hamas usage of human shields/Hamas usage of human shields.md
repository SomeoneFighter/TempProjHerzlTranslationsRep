Often, pro-Palestinian voices deny Hamas's use of human shields. However, substantial evidence demonstrates that this tactic has been employed by Hamas—a terrorist organization that aims to establish an Islamist theocracy in Israel—and continues to this day.  

‎  
## Definition and Explanation
To define it simply, **human shields** involve the use of civilians or civilian infrastructure as protective barriers for military operations or assets. This strategy includes placing military equipment, personnel, or activities within or near civilian-populated areas to deter or complicate enemy attacks. for a more in-depth argument specifically on Hamas usage of civilian **infrastructure**, check [this](https://arguments.projectherzl.com/offensive-arguments.html?argument=Hamas-usage-of-civilian-infrastructure) argument.

‎  

The practice of using human shields is universally condemned because it deliberately endangers civilian lives, complicates military operations, and often results in increased civilian casualties. This tactic significantly harms communities by elevating the risk of injuries and deaths among non-combatants. Despite denials, available evidence, outlined below, confirms Hamas's repeated and ongoing use of human shields, endangering countless civilians in the process.  

‎  

**The Fundamental Difference:**  
The distinction between Israel and Hamas is stark:  
‎ ‎ **-** Israel develops defensive systems like the Iron Dome to protect its civilians.  
‎ ‎ **-** Hamas, on the other hand, uses civilians to shield its military infrastructure, putting their lives at risk to protect its weapons.  

‎  

## International Law
The use of human shields is explicitly prohibited under **Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions**:  

‎  

**Article 48**:  
> Parties to the conflict must always distinguish between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives, directing operations solely against military objectives.  

‎  

**Article 51**:  
> The presence of a military objective within or near civilian objects does not alter the civilian object's protections. Civilians and civilian areas must not be used to shield military objectives or operations.  

‎  

This unequivocal prohibition highlights the gravity of Hamas’s actions, which exploit civilians in direct violation of international law.

**Additional Context:**  
Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzouk openly stated, *"Tunnels in Gaza were built to protect Hamas fighters, not civilians.
