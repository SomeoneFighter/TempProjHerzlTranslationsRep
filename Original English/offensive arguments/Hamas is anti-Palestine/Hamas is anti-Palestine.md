**Videos of Hamas Beating Civilians (Palestinians)**  

‎  

Hamas is often presented as a representative of Palestinian interests, particularly in the Gaza Strip. However, its actions and policies frequently undermine the broader Palestinian cause and harm the very people it claims to protect.  

‎  

Historically, Hamas has positioned itself as a staunch adversary of Israel, engaging in actions that have caused significant suffering in the Jewish state. Yet, it is clear that Hamas has little interest in improving the daily lives of Palestinians. Its singular focus remains on waging war against Israel, even at the expense of the Palestinian population it governs.  

‎  

*The following points illustrate how Hamas acts contrary to Palestinian interests:*  

‎  

**Militarization and Conflict:**  
Hamas’s prioritization of armed resistance and military operations against Israel has led to repeated cycles of violence, inflicting immense suffering on Palestinians, particularly civilians. These actions provoke severe Israeli military responses, which exacerbate the humanitarian crises in Gaza without delivering meaningful gains for the Palestinian people.  

‎  

**Human Rights Violations:**  
Hamas’s authoritarian rule in Gaza has drawn criticism for its suppression of freedoms, including speech, assembly, and political dissent. By silencing opposition and stifling democratic discourse, Hamas undermines the development of a pluralistic and inclusive Palestinian society.  

‎  

**Economic Mismanagement:**  
Despite receiving substantial international aid since 2005, Gaza continues to face dire economic conditions. Instead of focusing on rebuilding infrastructure and improving public services, Hamas has funneled resources into military activities, such as constructing tunnels and acquiring weapons. This misallocation of funds has left Gaza with crumbling infrastructure, inadequate healthcare, failing schools, and a worsening water crisis.  

‎  

**Statements from Hamas Leadership:**  
Recent declarations from Hamas officials highlight the organization’s disregard for the well-being of Gazans. Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk openly stated that Hamas does not consider itself responsible for protecting Gazan civilians during conflicts, instead shifting this responsibility to international organizations like the United Nations and the State of Israel. Such admissions reveal a troubling abdication of duty and further undermine Hamas’s portrayal as a defender of Palestinian rights.  

‎  

Moreover, Hamas has acknowledged that its extensive network of tunnels in Gaza is intended for military purposes, not civilian protection. This admission underscores a disturbing prioritization of military objectives over humanitarian needs. By emphasizing operational security over civilian welfare, Hamas places its militant agenda above the lives and safety of Gazans.  

‎  

These facts demonstrate that Hamas’s actions are not only negligent but actively detrimental to the Palestinian cause. By shirking its responsibility to safeguard civilians and focusing on military endeavors, Hamas exacerbates Gaza’s humanitarian crisis and perpetuates the suffering of its people. This reality challenges the legitimacy of Hamas as a governing authority, exposing the disconnect between its rhetoric and the daily hardships faced by ordinary Palestinians. Rather than advancing Palestinian interests, Hamas has become a significant barrier to their welfare.
