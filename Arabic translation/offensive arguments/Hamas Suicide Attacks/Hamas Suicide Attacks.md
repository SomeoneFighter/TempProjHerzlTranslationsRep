A suicide bombing, also referred to as a suicide attack, is an act in which an individual personally carries and detonates explosives with the intent to cause maximum destruction, resulting in their own death. Hamas has employed suicide bombings against Israel multiple times. They honor the suicide bombers by calling them "Shahids" or "Martyrs" and claim that such individuals are rewarded in the afterlife with promises such as 72 virgins in heaven. Hamas has openly acknowledged and even celebrated the use of suicide bombers, famously stating, "while the Israelis value life, we value death." During the 2023-2024 Israel-Hamas conflict, Hamas official Khaled Mashaal [**urged**](https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-hamas-official-mashaal-urges-resumption-of-suicide-bombings-against-israel/) the resumption of suicide bombings in the West Bank.

The first Palestinian suicide attack took place in 1989, with the peak of such attacks occurring in 2002 during the Second Intifada. A 2007 study on suicide bombings during this period (September 2000 through August 2005) found that 39.9% of these attacks were attributed to Hamas.
