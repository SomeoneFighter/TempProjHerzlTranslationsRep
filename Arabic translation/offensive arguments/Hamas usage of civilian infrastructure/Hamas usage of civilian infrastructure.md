Throughout its history and continuing to this day, Hamas has repeatedly utilized civilian infrastructure as a shield for its militant activities. The organization has exploited mosques, hospitals, and even schools as integral components of its terror operations. These include the construction of underground tunnels, safe havens for operatives, command and control centers for orchestrating attacks, rocket and anti-tank missile launch sites, and weapons storage facilities. This deliberate strategy not only endangers civilians but also violates international norms designed to protect non-combatants during conflict.

# Mosques
## Jabriyat Mosque in Jenin
On November 19, 2024, during counterterrorism operations in the Jenin area, terrorists opened fire on IDF soldiers from within and around a mosque, using it as cover.
The following morning, soldiers revisited the mosque to conduct a search and discovered a shooting range on its lower floor, along with a training area and shooting positions that overlooked both the soldiers and the surrounding area. Dozens of spent bullet casings were found next to each window, remnants of the gunfire from the previous night's assault.

‎

## Khalid Ibn al-Walid Mosque in Jenin
During the same operational activity, an Israel Air Force (IAF) aircraft observed a significant number of heavily armed terrorists engaging IDF soldiers, strategically using the mosque as cover for their attacks.

‎

## Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Mosque in Tulkarm
During operational activity in Tulkarm, an Israel Air Force (IAF) aircraft detected terrorists launching explosive devices at IDF soldiers from the roof of the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Mosque. The terrorists positioned themselves on the mosque’s roof, using it as a vantage point to target the soldiers, further exploiting the mosque's structure for cover in their hostile actions.

‎

## Additional cases
On July 29, IDF special forces engaged and eliminated an armed terror cell guarding a mosque used as a Hamas military compound. After the battle, soldiers searched the mosque's basement and found a significant weapons cache, including sniper rifles, RPGs, and machine guns, as well as two hidden tunnel entrances, one extending 14 meters underground.

‎

The following day, a joint IDF task force located the entrance to another tunnel used by Hamas terrorists to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. This entrance, found in the basement of a mosque, led to a tunnel that served as a Hamas terrorist bunker.

# Schools
## Terrorists Eliminated in Al-Taba’een School Mosque
The IDF and ISA targeted terrorists operating in a Hamas command and control center embedded inside a mosque at the Al-Taba’een school compound. Following intelligence investigations, it has been confirmed that at least 31 Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were eliminated. These terrorists were involved in advancing and carrying out attacks against IDF soldiers and the State of Israel from within the compound. The strike was conducted with three precise munitions, which, based on professional analysis, did not cause the extent of damage reported by the Hamas-run Government Information Office in Gaza. No significant damage was inflicted on the compound. Prior to the strike, measures were taken to minimize the risk to civilians, including the use of a small warhead, aerial surveillance, and intelligence gathering.[[6](https://i.postimg.cc/4xkxzJjn/0906da67-2f4f-4f4e-94e6-698f2c30bee4.jpg)][[7](https://i.postimg.cc/c0jgxW9p/22479cd4-c7a8-4b59-9850-2ce3ce2b09d3.jpg)][[8](https://i.postimg.cc/0N95BVks/8b219161-06e2-444a-b85c-57ee83cf3cf8.jpg)]

## Tunnel Route Found Near UNRWA School in Rafah
The 12th Brigade, under the command of the 162nd Division, has been carrying out intelligence-driven, targeted operations in the Rafah area, successfully thwarting terrorist activity, eliminating terrorists, and destroying infrastructure. During these operations, several significant tunnel shafts were discovered, leading to a tunnel network. The route, which is 500 meters long, passes near an UNRWA school and was subsequently investigated by Yahalom soldiers.[[9](https://i.postimg.cc/0jSbsrLR/6ddf9d4b-4ccf-41c4-9b21-4be22572f597.jpg)][[10](https://www.idf.il/media/y5obmqbn/rocket-launcher-1.jpeg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=590&rnd=133643031801270000)][[11](https://www.idf.il/media/teohup3j/rocket-launcher-4.jpeg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=590&rnd=133643031822100000)][[12](https://www.idf.il/media/ikkf2ncm/rocket-launcher-3.jpeg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=590&rnd=133643031813470000)][[13](https://www.idf.il/media/zbyng0d5/rocket-launcher-2.jpeg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=590&rnd=133643031808000000)]

# Hospitals
Hamas has a long history of exploiting hospitals for terrorist activities, including using them as launching sites for rockets, falsely accusing Israel of attacking hospitals they had repurposed, and even accidentally firing rockets at their own facilities, subsequently blaming Israel for the damage. This tactic has been employed so frequently that it has become strongly associated with Hamas in the public consciousness.
