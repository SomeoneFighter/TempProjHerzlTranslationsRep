There has never been an independent state specifically called "Palestine". The term "Palestine" itself was first used by the ancient Greeks.
[The Greek historian Herodotus referred to a "district of Syria, called Palaistinê" in the 5th century BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_name_Palestine#cite_note-Abar-15).
This term was derived from "Philistia", the land of the Philistines, who inhabited the southern coastal regions of what is now the Gaza Strip.
Note that the modern Arab Palestinian population who currently inhabit the Gaza strip has nothing to do with the [Philistines as they were non-semetic sea raiders from the Aegean sea.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Philistine-people)

‎

The name "Palestine" was later [adopted by the Romans. After suppressing the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) the Roman Emperor [Hadrian renamed the province of Judea to "Syria Palaestina" in an attempt to minimize Jewish identification with the land](https://romanhistory.org/provincias/provincia-syria-palaestina).

‎

Throughout these periods, the region was ruled by various empires and never existed as an independent state specifically called "Palestine". It was part of larger administrative regions under the control of these empires.

[**second image:**](http://arguments.projectherzl.com/offensive%20arguments/Palestine%20was%20never%20a%20country/NetiveyEretzIsrael.png) some Palestinians are enthusiastic about this plane that was photographed in 1937, obsessing that it belongs to the ‘Palestine Airways’ company. They see this as a picture that proves it belonged to them even before the State of Israel was established.
The only problem is that they haven’t noticed that in the same picture, it says on the plane in Hebrew- "Eretz Israel Airlines", and it was actually a Hebrew-speaking airline founded by Pinchas Rotenberg.

The Arabs are the ones who conquered parts of the Land of Israel and attributed the name "Palestine" to themselves.
