### The Evidence of Palestinian Support for Hamas
‎
It is often argued that Palestinians do not broadly support Hamas, yet the available evidence from credible sources contradicts this claim. Hamas, designated as a terrorist organization by many countries, is responsible for significant acts of violence against Israeli civilians and military personnel. Public opinion data from within Palestinian territories highlights a substantial level of support for both the group and its actions.
‎
1. **Public Sentiment in Palestinian Territories**  
   A poll conducted by the *Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR)* provides crucial insights:
   - **67%** of Palestinians (57% in Gaza and 73% in the West Bank) expressed support for the October 7 attacks.
   - **82%** believe these attacks successfully brought international attention to the Palestinian cause and opened new avenues for statehood.
   - **75%** of respondents were satisfied with Hamas's wartime performance, and **65%** supported Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's actions.  
   - Additionally, **54%** of Palestinians who viewed footage of the events claimed disbelief in reports of atrocities committed by Hamas during these attacks.

3. **Hamas Leadership Statements**  
   Hamas leaders have publicly confirmed their intent to replicate the October 7 attacks, underscoring their alignment with the views of their supporters.  
   - Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, vowed that such operations would continue "many times in the future" until Israel is eradicated. *(Source: [Twitter - MEMRI Reports](https://twitter.com/MEMRIReports/status/1719662664090075199))*.
   - Khalil al-Hayya, another prominent leader, stated that Hamas does not regret the attacks despite the destruction and loss of life in Gaza. *(Source: [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-khalil-alhayya-qatar-ceasefire-1967-borders-4912532b11a9cec29464eab234045438))*.
‎
4. **Democratic Support in Elections**  
   Hamas was democratically elected in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, securing a majority of seats. The group’s founding charter explicitly calls for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state. These facts provide further evidence of significant political and ideological support for Hamas within Palestinian society.

### Conclusion  
The data demonstrates a pattern of widespread support for Hamas among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. While not all Palestinians may agree with every aspect of Hamas's actions or ideology, the evidence points to a strong alignment between a significant portion of the Palestinian population and the goals and strategies of Hamas. This support underscores the complexity of the conflict and the challenges in achieving lasting peace.
