On October 7, Hamas abducted 251 hostages, some from the Kibbutzim they attacked and others from the Nova Festival. As of today, August 27, 2024, 108 individuals remain in captivity. However, those who have been freed recount harrowing experiences of their ordeal.
‎
Many hostages released from Gaza in November are still grappling with profound trauma, according to Dr. Renana Eitan, head of psychiatry at Tel Aviv's Ichilov Medical Center. Dr. Eitan described the abuse suffered by the hostages as the worst she has encountered in her career. Among the 14 freed hostages currently under treatment are children who were drugged with ketamine and are now enduring withdrawal symptoms, survivors of sexual violence, and individuals who were confined in cages or kept in darkness.
‎
Dr. Eitan further explained that the initial joy displayed by the hostages upon release was often superficial. Many, especially children, are haunted by recurring nightmares, overwhelming fear, and dissociative episodes where they momentarily believe they are still in captivity. The use of drugs like ketamine and benzodiazepines by the captors has resulted in severe withdrawal symptoms.

In a heartfelt interview, a former Israeli hostage, identified as Noa, shared her intense fear of sexual assault while held in Gaza. She revealed that the constant threat of sexual violence was among her greatest fears during captivity. Noa also described how fear tactics and threats were used by her captors to exert control. Released in a prisoner exchange, she continues to grapple with trauma stemming from her ordeal, highlighting the psychological and physical scars borne by many hostages.

The release of hostages has brought to light the severe conditions they endured during captivity. Freed individuals are now receiving comprehensive medical and psychological support. Reports of extreme trauma, including physical abuse and psychological distress, underscore the brutality of their treatment. The release of hostages was part of a broader agreement between Israel and Hamas to address the humanitarian crisis and secure their freedom. However, the long-term recovery of these survivors remains a significant challenge.

The accounts of former hostages reveal the inhumane conditions they endured. Survivors reported being subjected to regular beatings, food deprivation, and unhygienic environments, including lice infestations. These experiences left them physically weakened and emotionally scarred. The testimony of these individuals emphasizes the importance of sustained medical and psychological care in their recovery process.
