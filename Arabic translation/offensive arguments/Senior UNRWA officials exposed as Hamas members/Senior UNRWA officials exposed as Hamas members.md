in the first image of this argument, you can see Fatah Sharif, chairman of the UNRWA teachers’ association (UNRWA logo circled in red) that was killed in the attack today (sep, 30, 2024).
in the second image of this argument, you can see the same Fatah Sharif, in an official Hamas proclamation in which it announces that the fresh elimination is none other then "Commander of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in Lebanon and Member of the Movement’s Leadership Abroad".
Hamas is a central pillar of UNRWA, as it was in Gaza, so it is in Lebanon.
