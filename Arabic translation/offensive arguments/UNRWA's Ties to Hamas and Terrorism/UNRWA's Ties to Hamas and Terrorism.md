### UNRWA and Alleged Connections to Hamas

#### Overview
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has been widely regarded as a neutral humanitarian organization. However, numerous reports have raised concerns regarding its alleged ties to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization by many nations, including the United States and the European Union. Evidence suggests that individuals within UNRWA, including senior officials, have links to Hamas and have facilitated extremist activities under the guise of neutrality [[1]](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/the-unrwa-hamas-connection/).

‎

#### Allegations of Hamas Affiliation
‎ ‎ 1. **Hamas Influence on UNRWA Personnel:**  
   Investigations have exposed direct affiliations between UNRWA employees and Hamas, [including senior officials](https://arguments.projectherzl.com/offensive-arguments.html?argument=Senior-UNRWA-officials-exposed-as-Hamas-members). These individuals have been documented glorifying acts of terrorism and promoting antisemitic narratives within UNRWA facilities. For example, UN Watch reported multiple cases of teachers sharing extremist content on social media [[2]](https://civicrm.unwatch.org/civicrm/mailing/view?reset=1&id=2413).  

‎

‎ ‎ 2. **UNRWA-Run Schools as Propaganda Centers:**  
   UNRWA schools have reportedly served as platforms for disseminating Hamas propaganda. According to reports, textbooks used in these schools glorify violence and incite hatred against Israel and Jews [[3]](https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=cda888712516195d04c9534ec&id=9e510e8a3e).

‎

#### Misuse of UNRWA Facilities
‎ ‎ 1. **Weapons Storage and Military Operations:**  
   UNRWA facilities, including schools and hospitals, have been exploited as storage sites for weapons and as operational bases for Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) documented cases of Hamas using UNRWA schools to store military equipment and launch attacks [[4]](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/the-unrwa-hamas-connection/exploitation-of-unrwa-schools/).  

‎

‎ ‎ 2. **Human Shields and Strategic Cover:**  
   Hamas militants have allegedly used UNRWA schools to shield their activities from retaliation. During the October 7 conflict, UNRWA schools were used to house weapons and launch attacks, often with children present to deter counterstrikes [[5]](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rockets-target-southern-israel-as-idf-presses-on-across-gaza-strip/).

‎

‎ ‎ 3. **Use of Headquarters for Hamas Operations:**  
   Beyond schools, UNRWA headquarters and other facilities have reportedly been co-opted by Hamas for planning and coordination. Militants have utilized these sites, taking advantage of their protected status under international law [[6]](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/the-unrwa-hamas-connection/exploitation-of-unrwa-headquarters/).
‎

#### Calls for Accountability
Critics argue that UNRWA has failed to implement sufficient oversight to prevent its facilities and staff from being exploited by Hamas. This has led to questions about its neutrality and the appropriateness of continued international funding for the agency [[7]](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-810518).
