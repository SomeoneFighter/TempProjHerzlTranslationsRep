If one were to read the UN's 200-page report on the Great March of Return (2018–2019), they might walk away with the distorted impression of a peaceful civilian demonstration, unjustly met with lethal force by an indiscriminate Israeli military. However, a deeper investigation reveals a far more complex and manipulated reality. Hamas and other militant factions in Gaza were intricately involved, exploiting civilians and militants alike to provoke the IDF and engineer media-driven victimhood narratives. Their most egregious deceit was the systematic concealment of militants' presence among the demonstrators from the outset of the so-called "peaceful" march.

Surprisingly, even a pro-Palestinian YouTuber, known for leftist leanings, identified these discrepancies through independent research. His analysis revealed that approximately 30% of those killed during the protests were militants or affiliated with militant organizations—a stark contrast to the UN's figures. Moreover, his findings highlighted that militants were present from the very beginning of the march, directly contradicting the UN's assertion that their involvement only escalated later.

This flawed report has not only misled the international community but has also been used as a cornerstone in debates by pro-Palestinian academics, such as Norman Finkelstein, whose reliance on this narrative is evident in discussions with figures like Benny Morris and Destiny.

For a more detailed exploration of these findings, the following resources are invaluable:

This raises a critical question: If the UN could embed such subtle yet significant distortions in this report, how many more inaccuracies or misrepresentations might exist in their coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? What other truths remain buried, and how can pro-Israel advocates effectively expose them?
