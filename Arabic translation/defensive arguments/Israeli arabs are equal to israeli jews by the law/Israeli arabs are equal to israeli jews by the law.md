## Arab Citizens of Israel: Rights, Identity, and Representation

Arab citizens of Israel make up approximately **20% of the country's population** and have a unique status in the region, enjoying civil rights within a Jewish-majority state. However, their situation is complex and often misunderstood. This exploration dives into their rights, identity, and political representation, grounded in Israeli law and current data.

## Legal Rights and Protections
#### **Declaration of Independence**  
Israel’s **Declaration of Independence**—often used as a foundational legal document—explicitly promises equality:  
> **"The State of Israel ... will uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of race, creed, or sex; will guarantee full freedom of conscience, worship, education, and culture; will safeguard the sanctity and inviolability of the shrines and Holy Places of all religions."**  
#### **Basic Laws**  
Israel's **Basic Laws** function as de facto constitutional principles and ensure rights for all citizens:  
‎ ‎ 1. **Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty**  
   This law protects:  
‎ ‎ **-** **Life, body, and dignity** of every human being.  
‎ ‎ **-** **Property rights** of individuals.  
‎ ‎ **-** **Freedom of movement** (citizens can freely enter or leave the country).  
‎ ‎ **-** **Right to privacy**.  
‎ ‎ **-** These rights apply universally, regardless of religion or ethnicity. [Full text here](https://www.lawandisrael.org/themencode-pdf-viewer/?file=https://www.lawandisrael.org/wp-content/uploads/Topics/Legislation/Basic-Laws/BasicLawLiberty.pdf#zoom=page-height&pagemode=bookmarks).  
‎ ‎ 2. **Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation**  
   Guarantees that **“Every citizen or inhabitant of the State is entitled to engage in any occupation, profession or trade.”** [Read more here](https://www.lawandisrael.org/themencode-pdf-viewer/?file=https://www.lawandisrael.org/wp-content/uploads/Topics/Legislation/Basic-Laws/BasicLawOccupation.pdf#zoom=page-height&pagemode=bookmarks).  
#### **Equality in Practice**  
While rights are enshrined in law, challenges persist, including socio-economic gaps, allocation of resources, and representation in certain sectors. Efforts to address these disparities include government investments in Arab towns, education, and employment programs.

## Identity of Arab Citizens
#### **Poll on Identity**  
According to a 2021 poll by Tel Aviv University ([source](https://www.kas.de/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=0e141dca-8ac4-a77f-7045-f3a7d4c30991&groupId=252038)):  
‎ ‎ **-** **40%** identify as "Arab in Israel / Arab citizen of Israel."  
‎ ‎ **-** **15%** identify as "Palestinian."  
‎ ‎ **-** **11%** identify as "Israeli."  
‎ ‎ **-** **10%** emphasize religious identity above national or civil identity.  
This nuanced data reveals a plurality of perspectives, with many Arab citizens blending national, civil, and religious identities.  
#### **National Component Breakdown**  
‎ ‎ **-** **Civil identity with Israeli elements**: 49.7%.  
‎ ‎ **-** Includes "Arab citizens of Israel" (40.8%) and "Palestinian citizens of Israel" (8.9%).  
‎ ‎ **-** **Pure national identity**: 24.1%.  
‎ ‎ **-** Includes "Palestinian" (15.4%) and "Arab" (8.7%).  
‎ ‎ **-** **Religious identity**: 9.5%.  
This diversity of self-identification reflects the complex relationship Arab citizens have with the state of Israel.  

‎

## Political Representation
#### **Arab Members in the Knesset (Israeli Parliament)**  
Arab citizens are represented in Israel’s parliament through both Arab-majority and mixed political parties. Over the years, Arab members have held key positions, and their presence in the Knesset demonstrates their role in the democratic process. For a full list, see [Arab members of the Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arab_members_of_the_Knesset).  
#### **Mixed Coalitions**  
In recent years, Arab-majority parties like **Ra’am** (United Arab List) have even [participated in governing coalitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-sixth_government_of_Israel).
