# Reasons for the Disengagement
[The disengagement plan, proposed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, was driven by several key factors:](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi9kcqLnP6HAxWlzTgGHcaIFNwQFnoECAEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.britannica.com%2Fevent%2FIsraels-disengagement-from-Gaza&usg=AOvVaw1MbnemKoOXlz4wzUouKnQZ&opi=89978449)
**Security Concerns:** The [ongoing violence during the second intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada) and the high cost of protecting Israeli Civilians in Gaza were major concerns. The Israeli government believed that withdrawing from Gaza would reduce the burden on the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and improve overall security.
**International Pressure:** There was significant international pressure on Israel to make progress towards a political settlement with the Palestinians. By unilaterally withdrawing from Gaza, Israel aimed to avoid further international criticism and pressure.
**Persuit of Peace:** [There was hope that the full and complete disengagement from Gaza would bring peace](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/gaza-disengagement/) and end the second intifada which has claimed far too many innocent lives.

# Process of Removing Israelis
[The disengagement process involved several steps:](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjXhue5nP6HAxUicGwGHf5zA8MQFnoECCQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Funispal%2Fdocument%2Fauto-insert-205755%2F&usg=AOvVaw2ypEfOrTCKRVOPdCBtSHUS&opi=89978449)
**Government Approval:** The plan was approved by the Israeli government in June 2004 and by the Knesset (Israeli parliament) in February 2005.
**Evacuation Orders:** Israeli settlers were given evacuation orders and offered compensation packages to leave voluntarily. The deadline for voluntary evacuation was August 15, 2005.
**Forced Evictions:** For those who refused to leave, the IDF and Israeli police carried out forced evictions. This process involved significant resistance and protests from some settlers.
**Demolition of Settlements:** After the evacuation, Israeli forces demolished the residential buildings in the settlements to prevent their reuse.

# Public Reaction
**Supporters:** Some viewed it as a necessary step towards peace and a way to reduce the burden on Israeli security forces.
**Opponents:** Others saw it as a concession to terrorism and a betrayal of the settlers who had lived in Gaza for decades.

‎

# Aftermath
**Gazan Reaction:** The reaction of Gazans to the Israeli disengagement in 2005 was mixed and complex. Many Palestinians celebrated the withdrawal, viewing it as a victory and a step towards ending the Israeli occupation. There were public celebrations and a sense of triumph among many Gazans. 
However, there was also skepticism about whether the withdrawal would lead to genuine peace and improvement in living conditions. Some Gazans were concerned about the future governance and economic stability of the region. 
Additionally, some Gazans felt sadness and concern about losing certain benefits that came with the Israeli presence, such as [employment opportunities, access to advanced healthcare, and economic stability.](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/new-polls-show-most-gazans-want-israeli-jobs-not-hamas-mobs) The disengagement led to significant political changes in Gaza, with Hamas gaining popularity and eventually taking control of the region in 2007, leading to further conflicts and tensions with Israel.

# Further destruction and looting by Gazans
After the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2005, [there were instances where Gazans looted and destroyed some of the infrastructure left behind by the Israelis,](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2006/2/13/looters-steal-gaza-greenhouses) including greenhouses, factories, and other facilities. These greenhouses and facilities were intended to help boost the local economy and provide employment opportunities.
For example, American Jewish donors had purchased more than 3,000 greenhouses from Israeli settlers for $14 million and transferred them to the Palestinian Authority. [However, many of these greenhouses were looted and damaged shortly after the withdrawal, with irrigation hoses, water pumps, and plastic sheeting being taken.](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna9331863) This looting was a significant setback to efforts aimed at reconstructing Gaza’s economy.
