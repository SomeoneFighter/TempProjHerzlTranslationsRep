Some people claim that Yemenite Jews are not ethnically Jewish and are simply Arabs. However, this claim is incorrect.

‎

## Researches Explained
‎ ‎ **-** **Research on the Y chromosome**, which is passed from father to son, has shown that Yemenite Jews share a common paternal ancestry with other Jewish communities. This lineage is more closely related to other Jewish populations than to non-Jewish populations in the Middle East, including Arabs.
‎ ‎ **-** **Studies on mtDNA**, passed from mother to child, have also indicated that Yemenite Jews have a genetic profile similar to that of other Jewish populations, with a significant amount of their maternal ancestry tracing back to ancient Israel, rather than to the local Arab populations.
‎ ‎ **-** **Broad genome-wide studies** comparing the overall genetic makeup of Yemenite Jews with other populations have shown that they cluster genetically with other Jewish groups, such as those from Europe and the Middle East. This suggests a shared ancestry that is distinct from the non-Jewish populations of the Arabian Peninsula.

## Studies Sources
‎ ‎ **-** [**Hammer et al. (2000)**](https://www.pnas.org/content/97/12/6769): This study focused on Y chromosome markers and demonstrated that Jewish communities, including Yemenite Jews, share common paternal lineages that are distinct from those of local non-Jewish populations
‎ ‎ **-** [**Behar et al. (2008)**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002062): This study examined mitochondrial DNA across various Jewish populations, including Yemenite Jews, and found that they share maternal lineages with other Jewish groups, indicating a common origin
‎ ‎ **-** [**Nebel et al. (2001)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1274378/): This study analyzed Y chromosome data and found that Yemenite Jews, along with other Jewish populations, possess genetic markers that distinguish them from neighboring Arab populations, indicating a shared Jewish paternal ancestry
‎ ‎ **-** [**Shen et al. (2004)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182266/): This study explored autosomal DNA markers and demonstrated that Yemenite Jews cluster genetically with other Jewish populations, rather than with local Middle Eastern non-Jewish groups, supporting their shared ancestry
