## Debunking the Tantura Massacre: "The Massacre That Never Happened"
The claim of a massacre at Tantura in May 1948, during Israel’s War of Independence, has been a contentious topic for decades. Proponents of the narrative often rely on the discredited M.A. thesis of Teddy Katz, who alleged that Israeli forces carried out a massacre of Arab villagers. However, a critical review of the evidence, testimonies, and academic analysis reveals a narrative plagued by methodological flaws, contradictory testimonies, and unreliable sources. This discussion dismantles the claim of a "Tantura massacre" and highlights the discrepancies in the accusations.

‎

### **1. Contradictory Testimonies and Discredited Sources**
Amitzur Cohen, a figure cited in relation to the Tantura events, has repeatedly denied any massacre took place. In a 2018 interview, when asked explicitly about the alleged massacre, he responded with the Hebrew idiom *"לא דובים ולא יער"*—loosely translating to "not at all" or "nothing of the sort." This outright denial contradicts claims that Cohen was either a witness or a participant in the events at Tantura. Moreover, Cohen clarified that he wasn’t even a soldier in Tantura during the period in question, further undermining his utility as a reliable source for such accusations. Interestingly, he also alleged that local Arab refugees had perpetrated crimes against other refugees, such as raping women from the Fureidis village.  

‎

### **2. Flawed Academic Foundations: The Teddy Katz Thesis**
Teddy Katz’s M.A. thesis, presented at the University of Haifa, served as the foundation for the massacre allegations. However, the thesis was subjected to rigorous scrutiny by academic peers and was ultimately rejected by the university due to severe methodological shortcomings. According to the review panel:  
‎ ‎ **-** The thesis failed to verify the reliability of testimonies and did not distinguish between visual and oral accounts.  
‎ ‎ **-** It lacked criteria for assessing the validity of testimonies or for justifying the inclusion of some while excluding others.  
‎ ‎ **-** There was no systematic method of analyzing testimonies, a critical flaw for qualitative research.  
‎
In a particularly telling section of the revised thesis, Katz himself admitted uncertainty about key aspects of the narrative:  
> "We are unable, as far as existing data show, to establish definitely who were, at least in Tantura, those who killed the inhabitants of the village that capitulated, according to the evidence we have."  
Furthermore, Katz acknowledged conflicting versions of events, with death toll estimates ranging from 40 to 230, exposing a lack of concrete evidence.  

‎

### **3. The University of Haifa's Rejection**
After reviewing Katz’s amended thesis, the University of Haifa’s academic committee maintained its rejection. Five referees critiqued the thesis, with two rejecting it outright and three accepting it with harsh reservations. They cited foundational flaws in the research methodology, including:  
‎ ‎ **-** The absence of in-depth analysis.  
‎ ‎ **-** The lack of fundamental tools required for historical research.  
‎ ‎ **-** Overreliance on anecdotal and unverifiable testimonies.  
‎
These critical assessments underscore the thesis’s inability to meet basic academic standards and cast serious doubts on its conclusions.

‎

### **4. Broader Historical Context**
The narrative of the Tantura massacre has been amplified by individuals and organizations with political agendas, often ignoring the volatile realities of the 1948 war. At the time, Tantura was a strategic coastal village that resisted Israeli forces before its capture. Evidence suggests that casualties occurred during combat, not as part of a systematic massacre. Claims of mass graves have been investigated but remain unsubstantiated.
‎
Additionally, claims of massacres were not uncommon in Arab propaganda during and after the 1948 war, aimed at rallying support against the nascent Israeli state. The lack of contemporary documentation or reliable eyewitness accounts further weakens the credibility of the Tantura massacre narrative.

‎

### **5. Conclusion**
The Tantura massacre claim falls apart under scrutiny. Testimonies are contradictory, the academic foundation is discredited, and there is no conclusive evidence of systematic killings. The continued propagation of this narrative reflects political motives rather than historical accuracy. As Amitzur Cohen’s shifting accounts and outright denials demonstrate, the Tantura massacre is a myth unsupported by credible evidence.
