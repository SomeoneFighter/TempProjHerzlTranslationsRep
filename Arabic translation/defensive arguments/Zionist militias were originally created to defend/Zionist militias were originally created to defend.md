## The Haganah  
Before the Haganah, Jewish communities in Palestine relied on small, localized defense groups for protection. Known as "Shomrim" (Hebrew for "watchmen"), these groups operated as loosely organized militias, tasked primarily with defending agricultural settlements from bandits or threats posed by neighboring Arab populations. These early groups lacked formal coordination and military-grade training, more closely resembling farmers with rifles than professional soldiers.  
‎
The Haganah was established in 1920 during the British Mandate over Palestine. The post-World War I era saw a sharp increase in Jewish immigration to Palestine, fueled by the [Balfour Declaration](https://www.britannica.com/event/Balfour-Declaration). This influx of Jewish settlers intensified tensions with local Arab populations, culminating in violent events such as the [1920 Nebi Musa riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Nebi_Musa_riots) and the [1921 Jaffa riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_riots). These attacks on Jewish communities highlighted the inadequacy of the decentralized Shomrim, necessitating a more unified approach to security.  
‎
The Haganah emerged as an underground defense organization with centralized coordination. Unlike the Shomrim, it sought to protect all Jewish settlements rather than isolated agricultural communities. Over the years, the Haganah evolved into a structured paramilitary force. By 1948, as the British withdrew and the State of Israel was established, the Haganah became the foundation of the [Israel Defense Forces (IDF)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Haganah).

## Etzel/Irgun  
The Irgun, also known as Etzel (*Irgun Tzva'i Leumi*, Hebrew for "National Military Organization"), was established in 1931 as a breakaway faction from the Haganah. Dissatisfaction with the Haganah’s policy of [_havlagah_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havlagah) (restraint) led to this split. The Irgun believed that a purely defensive posture was insufficient to address Arab violence or British-imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration under the Mandate.  
‎
Irgun members adopted a strategy of "active defense," which included preemptive strikes and retaliatory attacks. Their methods escalated to include bombings, assassinations, and civilian-targeted violence—acts widely categorized as terrorism. Despite their controversial actions, Irgun leaders justified them as necessary measures in response to ongoing Arab aggression and British obstruction of Jewish self-determination.  
‎
The *Yishuv* (the organized Jewish community in Palestine) and the Haganah leadership condemned the Irgun's methods, considering the group illegal and refusing to formally recognize it.

## Lehi  
Lehi, also known as the Stern Gang (after its founder Avraham Stern), was formed in 1940 as a more radical offshoot of the Irgun. While the Irgun temporarily cooperated with the British during World War II to combat the Nazis, Lehi rejected this alliance. Its members viewed the British as imperial occupiers who restricted Jewish immigration and denied Jewish sovereignty in Palestine.  
‎
Lehi’s tactics were extreme, focusing on targeted assassinations and bombings to pressure the British into leaving Palestine. Notably, Lehi orchestrated the [assassination of Lord Moyne in 1944](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Lord_Moyne), a British minister in Cairo. Lehi even sought alliances with Axis powers, reasoning that cooperation with the enemies of Britain might further their goal of expelling British forces.  
‎
Both the *Yishuv* and the Haganah condemned Lehi’s violent methods and classified the group as illegal. While Lehi’s actions were motivated by a desire to establish Jewish sovereignty, their reliance on terrorism remains a deeply controversial aspect of their legacy.
