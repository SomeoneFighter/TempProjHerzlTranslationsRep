hamas [**reports**](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-six-week-drive-hit-hamas-rafah-scale-back-war-2024-02-19/) 6,000 militants dead in feburary. That gives us a rate of 750 militants dead per month making their total become 12,000 in the month of May.
Let's assume Hamas are masters of disguise, so let's knock off 2,000 making the total militants 10,000. There's 40,000 casualties.
its been reported that 70% of those are women and children, so 70% out of 40,000 is 28,000.
the rest are assumed to be men, which 10,000 of whom are militants, which leaves us 2,000 innocent men.
so 30,000 civilians, 10,000 militants.
the ratio is 3:1 of 3 civilians per militant, still falling below the global average of 9:1 of urban wars.
but for any backlash, let's just add an extra 10,000 to the civilian casualties. that's 4:1, still below the average.
and that's JUST using pro palestinian sources and the word of Hamas. neutral sources suggest a 2:1.

**Even by Palestinian health ministry itself the percentages are:**
39.4% - males from 18 - 59
18.9% are women
32.2% are children under 18
8.5% are 60+
clearly showing most deaths are men (and that also excluding the fact of combatant youths)
